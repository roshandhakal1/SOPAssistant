        "content": "The dispensing process varies depending on the type of dispensing and the equipment used.  The provided SOPs describe several variations:\n\n**General Dispensing Procedures (common across multiple SOPs):**\n\n* **Pre-Dispensing:**  Empty containers must be cleaned and free of dust and label residue before use (840-10-100-Rev20Draft1-Dispensing Operation.doc).  Ingredients are staged according to the Batch Ticket sequence, with multiple lots separated and using the oldest expiration date first (840-10-100-Rev20Draft1-Dispensing Operation.doc).  A Start-Up Checklist and Cleaning History are verified and signed by the operator, followed by QA notification (840-95-003-Rev4Draft1-BarLine \u2022 Dry Dispense.doc; 840-10-621-Rev1Draft1-Dispensing  for Flex Sifter.doc).\n\n* **Container Opening:** Containers are opened using a knife or scissors with a single pass, tearing if necessary (840-95-002-Rev3Draft1-BarLine \u2022 Wet Dispense.doc).  Visual inspection for texture, color, appearance, odor, and cross-contamination is performed (840-95-002-Rev3Draft1-BarLine \u2022 Wet Dispense.doc). For glass containers, a visual inspection is done before and after dispensing to check for damage (840-10-621-Rev1Draft1-Dispensing  for Flex Sifter.doc).  Any non-conforming material or damage necessitates stopping the process and notifying the supervisor and QA (840-95-003-Rev4Draft1-BarLine \u2022 Dry Dispense.doc; 840-10-621-Rev1Draft1-Dispensing  for Flex Sifter.doc).\n\n* **Dispensing Process:**  The operator scans the first lot number using the Drum Scan screen (840-95-003-Rev4Draft1-BarLine \u2022 Dry Dispense.doc; 840-10-621-Rev1Draft1-Dispensing  for Flex Sifter.doc).  For dry dispensing, the pallet with empty containers is placed outside the dispense room (840-95-003-Rev4Draft1-BarLine \u2022 Dry Dispense.doc; 840-10-621-Rev1Draft1-Dispensing  for Flex Sifter.doc). For wet dispensing, the pallet is placed inside the dispense room (840-95-002-Rev3Draft1-BarLine \u2022 Wet Dispense.doc). The scale is zeroed out (840-10-621-Rev1Draft1-Dispensing  for Flex Sifter.doc).  The operator informs the appropriate lead and supervisor of each ingredient and tempering time (840-10-100-Rev20Draft1-Dispensing Operation.doc).  In case of shift changes, operators and QA verify that all ingredients match the Batch Ticket (840-95-002-Rev3Draft1-BarLine \u2022 Wet Dispense.doc; 840-10-100-Rev20Draft1-Dispensing Operation.doc).\n\n* **Post-Dispensing:** The start time is recorded (840-95-003-Rev4Draft1-BarLine \u2022 Dry Dispense.doc; 840-10-621-Rev1Draft1-Dispensing  for Flex Sifter.doc).  In the case of dry dispensing using sacks, the sack material is disposed of (840-95-003-Rev4Draft1-BarLine \u2022 Dry Dispense.doc).\n\n**Specific Dispensing Methods:**\n\nThe provided SOPs detail variations for dry and wet dispensing (840-95-003-Rev4Draft1-BarLine \u2022 Dry Dispense.doc, 840-95-002-Rev3Draft1-BarLine \u2022 Wet Dispense.doc) and dispensing for Flex Sifter (840-10-621-Rev1Draft1-Dispensing  for Flex Sifter.doc).  The differences primarily involve container types and placement of pallets (inside or outside the dispense room).\n\n\n**Missing Information:**  The SOPs do not provide a complete picture of all dispensing processes, only those explicitly mentioned in the provided documents.  There may be other dispensing procedures not included in this selection.  Details on specific equipment usage beyond scanning and weighing are also limited.\n"

        "content": "The blending process, as described in the provided SOPs, varies depending on the size of the blender and the specific ingredients.  However, several common steps and considerations are outlined:\n\n**General Blending Process:**\n\n* **Blending Instructions:**  Each formula requires approved blending instructions (831-20-400-Rev3Draft1-Creating Blending Instructions.doc) before production.  These instructions are entered into the ROSS system and detailed on the batch ticket. They specify:\n    * Screen size (mesh size).\n    * Blend time, based on powder characteristics, percentages, number of powders, and prior experience.\n    * Ingredient addition order.\n    * Special instructions (e.g., prescreening).\n    * Ingredient information (name, product code).\n    * Blender size.\n    * Allowable blend sizes for various blenders.\n    * Safety requirements.\n\n* **Ingredient Handling (Small Blender - 3.5 Cubic Feet):** (840-10-500-Rev19Draft1-Blending Operation.doc)\n    * Ingredients are sifted through a screen to prevent contamination and ensure consistency.  Caution is advised to prevent spillage.  A small hole should be poked in ingredient bags to release vacuum.\n\n* **Ingredient Handling (Ten Cubic-Foot Blender):** (840-10-506-Rev2Draft1-Ten Cubic-Foot Blender.doc)\n    * Ingredients are sifted through a screen.  A metal-detectable scraper is used for material that doesn't pass through the screen.  Hands are not permitted for pushing ingredients. Industrial scissors are used to open bags.  Drum labels are scanned to verify ingredient quantities.\n\n* **Blending:** (840-95-010-Rev1Draft1-Bar Line Procedure.doc) & (840-10-500-Rev19Draft1-Blending Operation.doc) & (840-10-506-Rev2Draft1-Ten Cubic-Foot Blender.doc)\n    * Ingredients are added to the blender according to the blending instructions.  For larger blenders, the PTL blending control system does not directly interface with pumps; operators must manually pump ingredients until the correct mass is achieved (840-95-010-Rev1Draft1-Bar Line Procedure.doc).\n    * Ingredients are mixed thoroughly until homogeneous. Blending time depends on the recipe and consistency.\n    * For the small blender, the blender valve must be closed and secure before adding powder.  The lid must be closed and secure after adding powder.\n\n\n* **Post-Blending:** (840-95-010-Rev1Draft1-Bar Line Procedure.doc)\n    * The mixture is transferred to a day tank (holding tank).\n    * The blending process, steps, and ingredient measurements are recorded in PCLE material usage.\n    * Blending times (start/stop) are recorded.\n    * Any issues are promptly reported.\n\n* **Cleaning:** (840-95-010-Rev1Draft1-Bar Line Procedure.doc references SOP # 840-96-020 and SOP # 840-96-005 for cleaning procedures, but the details of these procedures are not provided in this document set.)\n\n\nThe provided SOPs do not completely detail every aspect of the blending process across all blender sizes.  Information on cleaning procedures, for example, is referenced but not fully described.\n"
