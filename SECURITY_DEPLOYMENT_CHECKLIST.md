## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Set environment to production: `export ENVIRONMENT=production`
- [ ] Configure secure OAuth credentials
- [ ] Set up HTTPS/SSL certificates
- [ ] Configure reverse proxy security headers
- [ ] Set up log rotation and retention

### Database Security
- [ ] Remove default admin password
- [ ] Create strong admin credentials
- [ ] Set secure file permissions on all data files
- [ ] Enable database encryption if using external DB
- [ ] Regular backup procedures

### Network Security
- [ ] Enable HTTPS only
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up intrusion detection
- [ ] Enable DDoS protection
- [ ] Configure rate limiting at proxy level

### Application Configuration
- [ ] Disable debug mode
- [ ] Remove verbose error messages
- [ ] Configure security headers
- [ ] Set secure cookie flags
- [ ] Enable HSTS

### Monitoring & Alerts
- [ ] Configure security alert emails
- [ ] Set up log aggregation
- [ ] Enable real-time monitoring
- [ ] Configure automated security scans
- [ ] Set up incident response procedures

## 🚨 Important Security Notes

1. **Change Default Credentials**: The default admin password is `ChangeMe123!@#`. This MUST be changed immediately upon deployment.

2. **Session Security**: "Remember Me" functionality has been disabled for security. Users must log in each session.

3. **File Permissions**: Ensure the application runs with minimal privileges and secure file permissions.

4. **Regular Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated, especially security-critical packages.

5. **Audit Logs**: Monitor `security_audit.log` regularly for suspicious activities.

## 🚀 Deployment Commands

```bash
# Set production environment
export ENVIRONMENT=production

# Run security validation
python -c "from security_config import SecurityConfig; print(SecurityConfig.validate_config())"

# Start application with security features
streamlit run app.py --server.enableCORS=false --server.enableXsrfProtection=true

2. **Access Review**: Audit all user accounts
3. **Log Review**: Check first 24 hours of logs
4. **Performance**: Monitor for security impact
5. **Training**: Ensure team knows security procedures
