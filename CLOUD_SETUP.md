# Cloud Storage Integration Setup

## Google Drive Integration

### Step 1: Create Google Cloud Project
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Click "Create Project" and give it a name (e.g., "SOP Assistant")

### Step 2: Enable Google Drive API
1. In the Google Cloud Console, go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
2. Search for "Google Drive API"
3. Click on it and press "Enable"

### Step 3: Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials
1. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
3. If prompted, configure the OAuth consent screen first:
   - User Type: External (for personal use) or Internal (for organization)
   - Fill in app name, user support email, developer email
   - Add your domain if needed
4. For Application type, choose "Desktop application"
5. Give it a name (e.g., "SOP Assistant Desktop")
6. Click "Create"

### Step 4: Download Client Configuration
1. After creating the OAuth client, you'll see a dialog with the client ID and secret
2. Click "Download JSON" to download the credentials file
3. The file will look like this:
```json
{
  "installed": {
    "client_id": "your-client-id.googleusercontent.com",
    "project_id": "your-project-id",
    "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
    "redirect_uris": ["urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob", "http://localhost"]
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Organize Your SOP Files
1. Create a folder in Google Drive (e.g., "SOP Documents")
2. Upload all your SOP files (.pdf, .docx, .doc, .csv, .md) to this folder
3. Note the folder ID from the URL when viewing the folder in Google Drive

### Step 6: Connect in the App
1. Open your SOP Assistant app
2. Go to "üìÅ Document Management" in the sidebar
3. Find the "‚òÅÔ∏è Google Drive Integration" section
4. Paste the JSON content from Step 4 into the configuration box
5. Click "Start Authentication"
6. Follow the OAuth flow to authorize access
7. Select your SOP folder
8. Click "Sync Documents"
